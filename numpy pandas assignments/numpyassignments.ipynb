    "\n",
    "### Assignment 8: Fancy Indexing and Boolean Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a NumPy array of shape (5, 5) filled with random integers. Use fancy indexing to extract the elements at the corners of the array.\n",
    "2. Create a NumPy array of shape (4, 4) filled with random integers. Use boolean indexing to set all elements greater than 10 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 9: Structured Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a structured array with fields 'name' (string), 'age' (integer), and 'weight' (float). Add some data and sort the array by age.\n",
    "2. Create a structured array with fields 'x' and 'y' (both integers). Add some data and compute the Euclidean distance between each pair of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 10: Masked Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a masked array of shape (4, 4) with random integers and mask the elements greater than 10. Compute the sum of the unmasked elements.\n",
    "2. Create a masked array of shape (3, 3) with random integers and mask the diagonal elements. Replace the masked elements with the mean of the unmasked elements."
